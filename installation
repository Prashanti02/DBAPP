Firstly, a user should install an application such as MAMP or Uniform Server. 
Then, we should run the SQL and Apache server
We can then create a php file inside a folder in either htdocs (if you are using xampp) or in www (Uniform server)
We can use a text editor to write the php code
Users can either use the database from sql server or from phpmyadmin to insert, delete, update information
In the php file, the localhst, username, and password should be set according to your server
The database should be connected to the php and users can run queries 
To access it in the browser, user can go to localhost/foldername. In case of more than one file in a folder, localhost/foldername/filename. 

This database can currently take in id from the user and display information of delegates.
